# Hi! I'm Lucien!
I am a 20yo who almost completed his apprenticeship as a professional IT-Guy. I work on my projects out of interest in the broad field of Information Technology.

I like to deploy my applications using docker-compose in order to provide an easy setup and configuration.

If you have any questions related to my projects or other programming issues you can reach me at: git@maln.dev.

For work related questions you can contact: work@maln.dev.
